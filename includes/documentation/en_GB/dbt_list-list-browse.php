        <p> The data extracted from a list is handled by a query that can be changed by the tab setup. However, modifying a list query can be a dangerous operation because it affects all configurations, so it would be best to try to modify the query of a list as little as possible. </p>
       <p> The configuration of the columns of a list can be changed from the "Formatting List View" tab. </p>
       <p> The view of the database tables plugin is meant to be modified only by the site administrators, if you want to allow other users to manage the contents of a list, go to the "settings" tab and activate the "Show in admin" options menu ". <br> This creates a shortcut in the administrative menu for the specified list </p>
